# Fused MoE compute and communication — AITER aiter

These paths fuse several stages of MoE, sometimes including inter-GPU communication. Their synchronization and buffer ownership are part of correctness, alongside local GEMM arithmetic.

This page describes AITER public wrappers and dispatch. AITER is the implementation provider; inspect the called Triton, Gluon, FlyDSL, HIP, CK, ASM or OPUS path before attributing performance to a backend.

## Scope and evidence

The source links below are pinned to AITER `e9995854abbd`. **Recent** means the file changed between 2026-07-21 and this snapshot. The symbol lists and parameter names are extracted from source; they include helpers as well as entry points. They do not certify runtime dispatch, hardware support or a measured speedup.

## Implementation files and entry points

## Configuration references

Use the matching wrapper/config loader. These files are tuning choices, not standalone proof of a performance gain.

## Tests and benchmarks

Related tests for this operator family are listed below. Select the entry point and backend that match the implementation; the presence of a test does not mean KernelWiki ran it or that every backend is covered.

## Performance and validation

Record TP/EP topology, expert placement, token counts and collective completion. A local GEMM speedup alone does not establish a fused-MoE gain.

No new GPU timings were collected for this page. Record GPU model, ROCm/compiler/library versions, full shape and strides, input/output dtypes, warmup and timing method, baseline implementation, latency and correctness tolerance before claiming a win. Compare speedups only within the same benchmark protocol and baseline.

## Historical knowledge

[GEAK implementation notes](aiter.md) retain older implementation explanations and dated performance evidence. Check their source revision before transferring a claim to this snapshot.
