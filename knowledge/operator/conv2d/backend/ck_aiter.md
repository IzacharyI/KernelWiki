# Conv2d — AITER ck

Entry points in this family have distinct input, layout and numerical contracts. Read the wrapper and its reference before choosing a replacement.

CK implementations select generated/template instances. The selected instance, layout and specialization determine behavior; compare through the same public wrapper and include required packing or reduction.

## Scope and evidence

The source links below are pinned to AITER `e9995854abbd`. **Recent** means the file changed between 2026-07-21 and this snapshot. The symbol lists and parameter names are extracted from source; they include helpers as well as entry points. They do not certify runtime dispatch, hardware support or a measured speedup.

## Implementation files and entry points

## Performance and validation

Compare identical inputs, layouts and outputs on the target architecture. Include preparation and postprocessing that execute in the live path.

No new GPU timings were collected for this page. Record GPU model, ROCm/compiler/library versions, full shape and strides, input/output dtypes, warmup and timing method, baseline implementation, latency and correctness tolerance before claiming a win. Compare speedups only within the same benchmark protocol and baseline.

## Historical knowledge

[GEAK implementation notes](ck.md) retain older implementation explanations and dated performance evidence. Check their source revision before transferring a claim to this snapshot.
